# Postmortem Report: Service Outage Incident
Date: June 21, 2024
Duration: 4 hours (08:00 - 12:00 UTC)
Team: Engineering
Facilitator: Emmanuel Asante
Attendees: Jane Smith, Alice Brown, Bob Johnson

## Issue Summary
Duration and Impact
The outage occurred on June 21, 2024, starting at 08:00 UTC and lasting for 4 hours until 12:00 UTC. During this time, the primary service API endpoints for our customer portal were intermittently unavailable. Approximately 60% of our users experienced degraded performance, with frequent timeouts and slow response times.
## Root Cause
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, which led to improper distribution of traffic among backend servers.

## Timeline
08:00 UTC: Issue detected by automated monitoring alerts indicating increased latency and error rates.
08:05 UTC: Engineers reviewed initial logs and identified intermittent 500 errors from API endpoints.
08:15 UTC: Investigation began into database connectivity issues as a potential cause.
08:30 UTC: Misleading path: Initial assumption of database overload was ruled out after further analysis of database metrics.
08:45 UTC: Incident escalated to senior engineering team for additional expertise and support.
09:00 UTC: Realized load balancer misconfiguration after reviewing recent configuration changes.
09:30 UTC: Load balancer settings were adjusted to evenly distribute traffic among backend servers.
10:00 UTC: Service gradually restored to normal operation as changes propagated.
12:00 UTC: Incident officially resolved with full service recovery and stabilized performance.

## Root Cause and Resolution
* Root Cause
The root cause of the outage was traced to a recent update in load balancer configuration, where a new algorithm intended for testing purposes was mistakenly deployed to production. This algorithm did not properly distribute incoming requests, causing some backend servers to become overloaded while others remained underutilized.
Resolution
To resolve the issue, engineers reverted the load balancer configuration to its previous stable version. This action restored proper traffic distribution and alleviated the strain on backend servers, thereby resolving the service degradation.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
* Improvements
Implement stricter change management processes for load balancer configurations to prevent unauthorized changes in production.
Enhance monitoring and alerting mechanisms to promptly detect and respond to similar misconfigurations in the future.
Tasks
## Review Change Management Policies:
* Conduct a thorough review of change management policies to include stricter approval processes and testing protocols for load balancer configurations.
* Implement Automated Tests:
Develop automated tests to validate load balancer configuration changes in a staging environment before deployment to production.
* Enhance Monitoring:
Expand monitoring metrics to include real-time traffic distribution analysis across load balancers and backend servers.
* Training and Awareness:
Provide additional training to engineering teams on identifying and mitigating misconfigurations effectively.
